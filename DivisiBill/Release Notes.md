# 6.2.1

## Add an Option to Show Web Service Information

The "About" page (a tab on the "Information and Problems" page) now has a "Show Web Service Information" checkbox.

If checked it shows the base URL used to reach the web service and details about the service itself if they are available.

# 6.2.0

## First Open Source Release

Prior to this release (November 2024) the DivisiBill sources were private, this moves them into open source. To build the released code you need to define a variety of secrets but the app runs without them. Without the defined secrets OCR and cloud storage are not available but all other features work.
