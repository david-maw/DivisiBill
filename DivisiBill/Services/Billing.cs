/// <summary>
/// <para>The billing class handles matters related to in-app billing. It relies on the InAppBilling plug-in
/// (the Plugin.InAppBilling nuget package) and the DivisiBill web service. For the purposes of this
/// discussion the license may be for a product or a subscription.</para>
/// 
/// <para>Professional licenses (usually subscriptions) enable cloud features, OCR licenses enable scans, 
/// you can buy an OCR license one whenever your scan counts drop below a threshold. Buying one adds a
/// fixed number of scans which then decrement as you perform OCR scans on individual bills. When the scan count
/// reaches zero we notify the store that the license has been consumed and you must buy another before more 
/// scans are allowed. The tracking is mostly done by the web service, but we keep a local copy of how many scans
/// we think are left for convenience even though the web service value is definitive.</para>
/// 
/// <para>The flow is that a user buys a license through the program using the store for the platform (only Android at
/// present) and then presents it to a web service for validation. The web service ALSO calls the store to validate the
/// license it was given was issued by the store and also checks that it is not in its list of known licenses. if that
/// validation passes, the license is stored in a table (so it's now a known one) and a value is returned to the caller
/// to tell it to acknowledge the license with the store.
/// If it is an OCR license we also return a count of OCR scans it enables the user to consume, and persist the new total
/// including unused scans from a previous license.</para>
/// 
/// <para>In the unlikely event that a purchase is interrupted in the middle the user might end up with a legitimate license
/// we've never seen. In that case the license is added to our store just as if it had gone through the normal purchase flow.</para>
/// 
/// <para>The pro license is checked at startup and intermittently thereafter <see cref="GetHasProSubscriptionAsync"/>. 
/// The OCR license management is mostly in the web service but it is occasionally checked 
/// <see cref="GetHasOcrLicenseAsync"/> against the web service to get the count of remaining scans for that license. 
/// The number of scans left is decremented whenever a scan is done by the web service and once the number left drops below a
/// threshold <see cref="ScansWarningLevel"/> the user is allowed to purchase a new license and we delete the old one (on 
/// Android you have to do that before you can buy another), see <see cref="ConsumeDepletedOcrLicense"/>. Any scans remaining on 
/// the old license are transferred to the new license.</para>
/// 
/// <para>If someone could get hold of a valid license and persuade an app to present it, they could scan bills and decrement 
/// the remaining scans on that license. This is exactly what we do for testing on Windows but that logic is only present in 
/// debug builds. Getting hold of a valid license from a release version of the code would be quite hard in that you'd need
/// to reach inside the DivisiBill code or decode HTTPS messages to do it. So not impossible, but a lot of work, which is the
/// point of all this (to make it more work than it is worth).</para>
/// 
/// <para>Because only a valid but previously unknown license ever allocates additional scans there's no obvious way to reuse
/// a license to get more scans, all you can do is consume the ones you've already been allocated. The Play Store for Android 
/// adds the additional wrinkle of acknowledging a license, but that's not necessary for the security of the process.</para>
