# People List

This is a list of the important areas on the People List page as seen from left to right, top to bottom. You can see an image of the page itself [here](peoplelistpage.html). If you got here by tapping one of the active areas in the page image, the relevant heading should be highlighted below.

## Icons

These appear in the toolbar at the top of the page or in the area revealed when you swipe on a line in the list.

#### Flyout (<u>&#xF035C;</u>)

This icon, in the top left corner of the screen, allows you to show or collapse the flyout menu to navigate to other pages.

### Use (<u>&#xF02FA;</u>)

### Add (<u>&#xF0419;</u>)

### Delete (<u>&#xF0A7A;</u>)

### Ellipsis (<u>&#xF01D9;</u>)

## Person

Each entry in this list represents a single person. You can swipe left to delete the entry or swipe right to add the entry as a participant in the current bill. If you got to this page by requesting to add a person to the current bill (see [here](totalsglossary.html#add)) it will return to that page after adding a participant to the current bill.

Tapping once on a person will select or deselect it, tapping twice switches to an editable details page for that person.
