# Program Settings Page

This is where program settings like default tip and tax rates are entered for the **Basic Edition** of the program (without the Professional Edition subscription).

Most fields are obvious, but you can tap on any highlighted area for further explanation (on a desktop browser you can also hover over an area to see its name).

If you are interested in the Professional Edition Program Settings page instead, you can see it [here](settingspage.html).
