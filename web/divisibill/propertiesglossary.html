<h1 id="bill-properties">Bill Properties</h1>
<p>This is a list of the less obvious areas on the Bill Properties page as seen from left to right, top to bottom. You can see an image of the page itself <a href="propertiespage.html">here</a>. If you reached this page by tapping one of the active areas in the page image, the relevant heading should be highlighted below.</p>
<h2 id="new-icon">New Icon</h2>
<p>Select this icon to start a new bill immediately.</p>
<h2 id="save-icon">Save Icon</h2>
<p>Select this icon to save a snapshot of the current bill immediately without altering the bill itself.</p>
<h2 id="tip">Tip</h2>
<p>You can specify either a Tip Percentage, in which case the amount will be calculated for you, or a Tip Amount, in which case the program will calculate a tip rate rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
<h2 id="tax">Tax</h2>
<p>You can specify either a Tax Percentage, in which case the amount will be calculated for you, or a Tax Amount, in which case the program will calculate a tax rate rounded to the nearest 0.25% and if necessary include a small amount (called a tax delta) to make the numbers add up to what the scanned bill says.</p>
<h2 id="tax-delta">Tax Delta</h2>
<p>This is used to indicate the difference between the tax amount and what would be calculated by multiplying the subtotal and the tax rate. Occasionally these differ by small amount (usually a cent) due to rounding; the Tax Delta can be used to account for the discrepancy. Tap the increment or decrement buttons to change the Tax Delta (this will also change the Tax Amount).</p>
<h2 id="scanned">Scanned</h2>
<p>Printed bills often have a Tax amount and a Subtotal amount printed on them; those values appear here if the program scanned them on the bill. If these values are set, they can be used to cross check the program's calculations (numbers which differ will be highlighted).</p>
<h2 id="venue-notes">Venue Notes</h2>
<p>These are notes relating to the venue the current bill is assigned to.</p>
