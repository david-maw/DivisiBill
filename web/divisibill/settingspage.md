# Program Settings Page

This is the **Professional Edition** Program Settings page, where program settings like default tip and tax rates are entered. This is also where you purchase OCR scans.

Most fields are obvious, but you can tap on any highlighted area for further explanation (on a desktop browser you can also hover over an area to see its name).

If you are interested in the Basic Edition Program Settings page instead, you can see it [here](settingspagebasic.html).
