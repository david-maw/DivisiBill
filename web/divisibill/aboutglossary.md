# About

This is a list of the less obvious areas on the Information and Problems pages. This focuses on the "About" page but "Release Notes" and "Report a Problem" are selectable from the list at the bottom of the page. 

## Information

This area describes the version of the app, whether it is the Professional or Basic Edition, and when it was built.

## Save Icon

Select this icon to save a snapshot of the current bill immediately without altering the bill itself.

## About AutoPlus

This button takes you to an external web site to learn more about AutoPlus. The same site also has a copy of this help text if you would rather view it in a web browser.

## About Xamarin

This button takes you to an external web site to learn more about the Xamarin technology used to create DivisiBill. Xamarin is being replaced by Microsoft MAUI at the time of writing (2023) but for the moment both are supported.

## Selectable Options

As well as this "About" page, you can select the "Release Notes" or the "Report a Problem" pages.

- Release Notes

    This contains a list of highlights of the changes in the current and previous releases.

- Report a Problem

    Use this option if you want to send something to the support team. It offers a text page pre-populated with some data where you can enter additional problem details to email to DivisiBill support.
