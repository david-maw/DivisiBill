<p>This is where program settings like default tip and tax rates are entered for the <strong>Basic Edition</strong> of the program (without the Professional Edition subscription).</p>
<p>Most fields are obvious, but you can tap on any highlighted area for further explanation (on a desktop browser you can also hover over an area to see its name).</p>

<p>If you are interested in the Professional Edition Program Settings page instead, you can see it <a href="settingspage.html">here</a>.</p>
