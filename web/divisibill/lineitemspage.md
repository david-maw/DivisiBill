# Items Page

This is where individual bill items and the information about them is entered, either manually or by scanning a bill. It looks something like this:

<object type=image/svg+xml data="lineitemspage.svg" height=600 style="width:90%"></object>


 Tap on a highlighted area to see what it does (on a desktop browser you can also hover over an area to see its name).
