# List of Bills

The Bills page is where the list of stored bills is shown. Individual bills may be stored locally, in the cloud, or both (if cloud access is allowed DivisiBill will copy local bills to the cloud for safekeeping). The same page layout is used regardless of the order of the bills in the list.

Tap on a highlighted area to see what it does (on a desktop browser you can also hover over an area to see its name).
