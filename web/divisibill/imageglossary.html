<h1 id="image-glossary">Image Glossary</h1>
<p>This is a list of the important areas on the Bill Image page as seen from left to right, top to bottom. You can see an image of the page itself <a href="imagepage.html">here</a>. If you reached this page by tapping one of the active areas in the page image, the relevant heading should be highlighted below.</p>
<h2 id="icons">Icons</h2>
<p>These appear in the tool bar at the top of the page.</p>
<h3 id="flyout">Flyout (<u>󰍜</u>)</h3>
<p>This icon, in the top left corner of the screen, allows you to show or collapse the flyout menu to navigate to other pages (navigate from the Items page to the Totals page by swiping left, back to the Items page by swiping right).</p>
<h3 id="light">Light (<u>󰉄</u>/<u>󰉅</u>)</h3>
<p>Turns the flashlight on or off (it will turn off when you use the camera).</p>
<h3 id="camera">Camera (<u>󰵝</u>)</h3>
<p>Opens the <a href="camerapage.html">camera page</a> so you can take a picture of the bill.</p>
<h3 id="ocr">OCR (<u>󱄺</u>)</h3>
<p>If you have the Professional Edition version of DivisiBill, this uses a cloud web service to scan the image to extract the data for the current bill.</p>
<h3 id="ellipsis">Ellipsis (<u>󰇙</u>)</h3>
<p>Tap on the ellipsis to open a secondary menu containing commands to delete the current image, take a picture of a replacement image or browse for a picture.</p>
<pre><code>- Delete - Remove the image from the current bill.
- Camera - Open the Camera page to take a picture of a bill.
- Browse - Browse and select from current images.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="image-area">Image Area</h2>
<p>This is where the bill image will be displayed once it has been processed (converted to gray scale and reduced in size). Modern mobile phones can take very high resolution pictures, which are unnecessarily large and detailed for OCR. DivisiBill reduces the resolution and converts the images to black and white to save storage space and analysis time.</p>
