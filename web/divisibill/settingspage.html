<p>This is the <strong>Professional Edition</strong> Program Settings page, where program settings like default tip and tax rates are entered. This is also where you purchase OCR scans.</p>
<p>Most fields are obvious, but you can tap on any highlighted area for further explanation (on a desktop browser you can also hover over an area to see its name).</p>
<p><object type=image/svg+xml data="settingspage.svg" height=600 style="width:90%"></object></p>
<p>If you are interested in the Basic Edition Program Settings page instead, you can see it <a href="settingspagebasic.html">here</a>.</p>
