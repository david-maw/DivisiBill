## Summary of Items

In this example, the Appetizer and Discount are shared evenly between 2 or more participants (+ in the left column), and the wine is shared unevenly (* in the left column). The Chicken, Beef and Fish are each allocated to a single participant. The beef is "comped" by the restaurant because it was not satisfactory (smiley face in the right column), so its cost won't be included in the subtotal or tax, just the tip (since it was not the server's fault the beef was overdone). The Discount amount reflects a coupon or promotion of some kind; that amount is also subtracted from the subtotal and tax but not from the tip calculation.
