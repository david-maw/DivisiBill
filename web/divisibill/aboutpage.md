# Information Page

This is a collection of useful capabilities. They can be selected using the tab bar at the bottom of the page.

- About 

    The About Page is the most complex. In the image below, tap on a highlighted area to see what it does (on a desktop browser, you can also hover over an area to see its name).

The other two pages are:

- Release Notes

    This contains a list of highlights of the changes in the current and previous releases.

- Report a Problem

    This offers a text page pre-populated with some data where you can enter additional problem details to send to DivisiBill support.
