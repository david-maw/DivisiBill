# Program Settings

This is a list of areas on the Program Settings pages as seen from left to right, top to bottom. Some of the page will look different depending on what options you have purchased, but this list describes all the options. An image of the settings page if you have purchased the Professional Edition and some OCR scans is [here](settingspage.html), or you can see an image of the page for the Basic Edition [here](settingspagebasic.html). If you reached this list by tapping an active area in one of those page images, the relevant heading should be highlighted below. Depending on your device you may need to scroll to see all the options.

## Title

This line tells you whether you are using the Basic Edition or have purchased a Professional Edition subscription and so have cloud storage capabilities.

## Location

This shows the current latitude and longitude of the device running the program, along with the estimated accuracy of that location. This is the value that will be used for the location of any new venue you create or any venue you use that doesn't currently have a location.

## Defaults

This area allows you to set defaults for various things used when calculating bill totals and splits. DivisiBill will warn you if the current bill is not using these defaults. This warning is especially helpful when you base a new bill on an older one and inherit old values that are no longer correct (like an outdated tax rate).

## Restore Hints Button

This button restores any hints hidden by selecting their "Hide this hint" checkbox. 

## Clear Checkboxes Button

Restores any dialogs hidden by checking their "Do not ask me again" checkbox (such as the crash dialog, for example).

## System Settings Button

Shows the system settings page for DivisiBill.

## Dark Mode Switch

Turns dark mode UI on or off - initially the setting is inherited from the system.

## Backup Switch

If you are running the Professional Edition, the "Allow Cloud Backup" switch allows you to specify whether or not to automatically back up changed items to the cloud. The Basic Edition of DivisiBill cannot use cloud backup but can use manual archiving instead. For more details, see [this](licensing.html) page.

## WiFi Switch

This selection is available only in the Professional Edition and is usable only when "Allow Cloud Backup" is set. If you turn on this switch, DivisiBill will automatically back up changed items to the cloud only when a WiFi connection is available to minimize the use of mobile data. If this switch is not set and cloud access is enabled, backup operations will occur whenever Internet connectivity is available. 
## Licensing Help

Tap here to open up the [licensing help](licensing.html) and learn more about Pro and OCR licenses.

## Modify Button

If you are using the Professional Edition, this button opens up a web site to permit you to view, modify or cancel that subscription.

## Subscribe

This allows you to purchase a Professional Edition subscription to enable cloud operations in DivisiBill; without a subscription, you should use manual archive/restore instead. For more details, see [this](licensing.html) page.

## Status

This shows you your Pro Subscription order number. In the Basic Edition this area is replaced by a "Subscribe" button.

## Scans

All versions of DivisiBill allow you to purchase "scans" to extract information from a picture of a printed bill, using cloud-based OCR scanning from the [Image](imagepage.html) page. Each OCR operation costs one scan; when the number of scans remaining reaches zero, you must buy more before another OCR operation will be allowed. (For more details see [this](licensing.html) page.) If you have scans remaining, this area will show you how many are left and the purchasing order number; otherwise it will show a button to order additional scans.

## Purchase Scans

Tap this button to purchase more scans.

## Send Crash Data

If the app faults this determines whether crash data is sent to support.

## Ask After Restart

Specifies whether to ask the "send crash data" question after the next app restart.
