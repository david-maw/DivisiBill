# List of Venues

The Venues List page is where the list of venues is shown. The list is stored locally and is backed up to the cloud when it changes if cloud access is allowed. The same page layout is used regardless of the order of the venues in the list.

Tap on a highlighted area to see what it does (on a desktop browser you can also hover over an area to see its name).
