# Flyout

When you click the hamburger icon (<u>&#xF035C;</u>) at the top left corner of the page, or pull out from the left margin, a "flyout" appears with a number of selections on it. It looks like this:

<object type=image/svg+xml data="flyout.svg" height=600 style="width:90%"></object>

You can click on one of the items to close the flyout and select the corresponding page or function.

Click on a highlighted area above to see what it does. Also note:

- "Help Index" shows you the index page for this set of help documents.
- "Current Page Help" shows help for whatever page you most recently selected.
- "Tutorial" takes you to a step-by-step tutorial page.
