<h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>
<p>Each entry in this list represents a single venue and (if it is known) its distance from your current location. You can swipe the entry left to delete the venue, or swipe right to choose between several options, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it the venue on the current bill (which may save the bill you were using previously if it has been changed). (<u>󰋺</u>)</li>
<li>Show the venue on the <a href="mappage.html">map page</a>.  (<u>󰦂</u>)</li>
<li>View and edit the venue details (name, location and notes) in the <a href="venueeditpage.html">venue edit</a> page. (<u>󱩽</u>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have elected to permit DivisiBill to know your location the current location will be stored as the coordinates for a venue when you assign the venue to a bill. You can also create and/or edit venue coordinates manually if you wish.</p>
