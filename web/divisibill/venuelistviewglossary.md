# Venue List

This is a list of the important areas on the Venue List page as seen from left to right, top to bottom. You can see an image of the page itself [here](venuelistviewpage.html). If you reached this page by tapping one of the active areas in the page image, the relevant heading should be highlighted below.

## Icons

These appear in the tool bar at the top of the page or in the area revealed when you swipe on a venue line.

### Flyout (<u>&#xF035C;</u>)

This icon, in the top left corner of the screen, allows you to show or collapse the flyout menu to navigate to other pages.

### Use (<u>&#xF02FA;</u>)

Uses the currently selected venue on the current bill. You can also swipe right on a venue to use it.

### Add (<u>&#xF0419;</u>)

Opens the venue detail page with a new venue so you can enter details and add it to the list.

### Delete (<u>&#xF0A7A;</u>)

Deletes the selected venue. You can also swipe left on a venue to delete it.

### Ellipsis (<u>&#xF01D9;</u>)

Tap on the ellipsis to open a secondary menu containing commands to show the venue on a map, show the venue details or download a list of venues.

## Heading

This shows the number of venues in the list and the sort order currently in use.

## Venue

Each entry in this list represents a single venue and (if it is known) its distance from your current location. You can swipe the entry left to delete the venue, or swipe right to choose between several options, either:

- Make it the venue on the current bill (which may save the bill you were using previously if it has been changed). (<u>&#xF02FA;</u>)
- Show the venue on the [map page](mappage.html).  (<u>&#xF0982;</u>)
- View and edit the venue details (name, location and notes) in the [venue edit](venueeditpage.html) page. (<u>&#xF1A7D;</u>)
 
If you have elected to permit DivisiBill to know your location the current location will be stored as the coordinates for a venue when you assign the venue to a bill. You can also create and/or edit venue coordinates manually if you wish.
