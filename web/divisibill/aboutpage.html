<li><p>About</p>
<p>The About Page is the most complex. In the image below, tap on a highlighted area to see what it does (on a desktop browser, you can also hover over an area to see its name).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><object type=image/svg+xml data="aboutpage.svg" height=600 style="width:90%"></object></p>
<p>The other two pages are:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li><p>Report a Problem</p>
