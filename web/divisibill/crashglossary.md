# Crash Popup

This is a list of the less obvious areas on the Information and Problems pages. This focuses on the "About" page but "Release Notes" and "Report a Problem" are selectable from the list at the bottom of the page. 

## Crash Dialog

This popup explains that there has been a previous crash and allows you to elect to send it for analysis or not. If you do choose to send it you'll be offered an opportunity to enter anything that might help the support team debug the error.

In addition you may also check "Do not ask me again" and the same answer will be assumed for future instances of this popup, if you want to undo that you can do so from the [Clear CheckBoxes](settingsglossary.html#clear-checkboxes-button) button on the [Settings Page](settingspage.html).
